<h1>Blackjack</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I developed a game of blackjack in java. The game consists of a player and a dealer, the player will get two cards with there current total. The player will also get to see one of the dealers cards but the other one will be face down leaving the dealers total hidden. The player will then get the option to 'hit' or 'stay' and will keep asking the player as long as their total does not exceed 21. If the play goes over 21 they will bust. If the player chooses to stay then the dealer will reveal the cards. For the player to win, they have to have a higher total than the dealer without going over 21 or have the dealer go over 21.
